## 🔌 API Endpoints

All implemented and working:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/` | GET | Serve main game page |
| `/api/new-puzzle` | POST | Generate puzzle (body: `{"difficulty": "easy\|medium\|hard"}`) |
| `/api/validate-move` | POST | Validate move & check solvability |
| `/api/solve` | POST | Get complete solution |
| `/api/hint` | POST | Get hint (one random empty cell) |

---

## 🎨 Key Implementation Details

### Invalid Move Handling (Critical Feature)
**Location:** `static/js/game.js:145` (placeNumber function)

**Behavior:**
1. User enters a number
2. Temporarily place number on board
3. Validate move via backend API
4. If invalid:
   - **Revert the move** (restore old value)
   - Flash cell red with animation
   - Show alert with error message
   - Deduct a life
   - Board remains in solvable state
5. If valid:
   - Save state to history
   - Flash cell green
   - Award points
   - Check for win condition

**Why this matters:** Board NEVER enters an unsolvable state. User gets feedback but game integrity is maintained.

### Puzzle Generation
**Location:** `app.py:26` (PuzzleGenerator class)

**Algorithm:**
1. Generate solved board by filling diagonal 3x3 boxes randomly
2. Use DFS solver to complete rest
3. Remove cells based on difficulty
4. Verify each removal maintains solvability
5. Return puzzle + solution

### Theme System
**Location:** `static/css/styles.css:1-77` (CSS variables)

**Implementation:**
- Two complete color palettes defined as CSS variables
- JavaScript toggles `data-theme` attribute on body
- localStorage persists user preference
- All colors reference variables (easy to extend with more themes)

## ⏭️ Next Steps: Cloud Deployment

### Current Blocker
- Code is committed to git but not pushed to GitHub
- Authentication issue prevents automatic push
- Need manual push to proceed with cloud deployment

### Deployment Plan (Render - Recommended)

**Step 1: Push to GitHub (Manual)**
```bash
cd "Sodoku-Solver"
git push origin main
```

If authentication fails, need to:
- Switch remote to HTTPS (already done)
- Use GitHub Personal Access Token as password
- Or run in terminal with proper SSH keys

**Step 2: Deploy to Render (10 minutes)**
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Create new Web Service
4. Connect repository: `ebber/Sodoku-Solver`
5. Configure:
   - Environment: Python 3
   - Build: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start: `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 4 app:app`
   - Plan: Free
6. Deploy and get URL: `https://sudoku-app.onrender.com`

**Full instructions:** See `RENDER_DEPLOY.md`

### Alternative Deployment Options
- **Railway** - $5 free credits/month, no sleep (see `QUICK_DEPLOY.md`)
- **Fly.io** - Free 3 VMs, requires Docker
- **Heroku** - $5/month minimum
- **See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for all options**

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Git Push Authentication
**Issue:** SSH key authentication fails, HTTPS prompts not working in bash tool
**Solution:** User must push manually in terminal with proper credentials

**Tried:**
- ❌ SSH push (permission denied)
- ❌ HTTPS push (can't handle interactive prompts)
- ❌ GitHub CLI auth switch (user blocked it)
- ✅ **User must push manually**

### Railway CLI Login
**Issue:** `railway login` requires interactive session (browser auth)
**Solution:** Switched to Render which has better web-only deployment flow

## 💡 Design Decisions Made

### Why Flask + JavaScript (Not Pure JS)
- User wanted GitHub Pages initially (static only)
- Explained: Puzzle generation/validation algorithms complex, better in Python
- Chose hybrid: Python backend (existing solver) + JS frontend
- **Decision:** Keep Python backend, deploy to proper hosting

### Why Render Over Railway
- Railway requires CLI login (interactive, can't automate)
- Render has full web-based deployment (no CLI needed)
- Both offer free tiers
- **Decision:** Render for easiest deployment

### Invalid Move Handling Philosophy
- Original: Invalid moves stay on board
- User requested: Flash red, revert, take life, show alert
- **Decision:** Board never enters invalid state, better UX

### Theme Implementation
- Could use multiple themes or just dark mode toggle
- User requested: "Light and Dark" themes specifically
- **Decision:** Two complete themes with switcher
